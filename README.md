# Showcase Portfolio - Jarvin Siegers
Iterations and validation moments

## Project Goals

The main idea was to draw inspiration from several award-winning portfolios featured on Awwwards. Many of these sites share common design elements and style choices that give a strong sense of professionalism and experience. My goal is to create something that captures that same impression.

To summarize:

- Improve at GSAP (animations) 
- Test my building skills on a *short* time limit
- Show my Next.js skills from all my previous projects

## Design Process

**Current trends**

I browse [Awwwards](awwwards.com) regularly, I try to get inspired and copy trends I see on there. In my opinion, this website is all you need, endless examples of professional work for enough inspiration for all your work.

99% of websites that have awards use GSAP for their animations and Lenis for smooth scroll. Many websites also love to use big text on their hero section, instantly grabbing the users attention.

**Portfolio Inspiration**

Below are some portfolios I used for inspiration:

- [15th Plus Studio](https://15th.plus-ex.com/)
- [Stella Petkova](https://www.stellapetkova.com/)
- [Olha Lazarieva](https://www.olhalazarieva.com/)
- [Wonjyou Studio](https://wonjyou.studio/)

## Reflection

My goal was to build a professional, minimalistic portfolio and I believe I succeeded in achieving that. I focused on clean design, subtle animations, and a well structured layout to highlight my work. The result feels both refined and modern, reflecting the style of award-winning portfolios that inspired it.
