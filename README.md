Current trends
I browse [Awwwards](awwwards.com) regularly, I try to get inspired and copy trends I see on there. In my opinion, this website is all you need, endless examples of professional work for enough inspiration for all your work.

99% of websites that have awards use GSAP for their animations and Lenis for smooth scroll. Many websites also love to use big text on their hero section, instantly grabbing the users attention.
